# Python path planning
I am currently practicing my python skill by implementing different path planning algorithms.

Here is the list of references:

- A-star: https://medium.com/@nicholas.w.swift/easy-a-star-pathfinding-7e6689c7f7b2
- PSO
- Comming soon...

## input
I convert a binary png image to a `np.array` (the function can be found on `utils.py`) and then it is used as the input of my algorithms.

## output
Is simply just a list of 2-d coordinate of waypoints.

Results can be found in the `img` folder.

Since this is for practicing and learning purpose, I welcome every comment and contribution :D
